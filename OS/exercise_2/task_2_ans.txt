Question 1:
After running 6 times the outputs are: 93,111,95,88,161,82
It doesn't show 15000 .One reason is because there are a lot of cases when 2 or 3 of the processes read the same value
then update with plus one.So it doesn't get incremented 3 times.Also sometimes the value gets decreased.
For example  process_1 may read the value 15.Then other processes increments this value 5 times to 
make it 20. But now process_1 will update it with value 16 resulting in decrease.

Question 2:
In the best possible case the range will be between (1-15000)

Question 3:
The code for this task is  written in modified_task2.c . I have also written the count.c that is required for
this task.
Instead of parallelly running the processes I have modified it to run in sequential manner. This way
each process runs without affecting other and we get 15000 in the end.
