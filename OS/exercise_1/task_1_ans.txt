# The code is in modified_task1
Question 1:
No, the program doesn't perform correct computation.For input 10 it prints 15 and for input 20 
it prints 55. It seems the program added the parent result(function A) but didn't include the 
child function result (call to funcion B).fork()ing creates an exact copy of the parent process 
at the time of forking. However, after the fork() is completed, the child has a completely different 
existence, and will not report back to the parent. The reason function B result was not added to 
the Total is because the parent's global variables do not alter by changes in the child.

Question 2:
To fix the issue we can return the result computed by the child process by using exit(result). Then 
the parent process can use wait(&status) and then get the result from WEXITSTATUS(status).
